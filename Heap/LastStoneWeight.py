'''
My thought process was to make a max heap. I loop until the length of the heap is not greater than 1. 
Inside the loop, I pop the max 2 elements and compare them. Depending on the comparison, I perform the necessary operations.
At the end, I check to see if the heap contains anything. 
If it does, return that one element. Else, return 0 (meaning that thereâ€™s no stone left).
