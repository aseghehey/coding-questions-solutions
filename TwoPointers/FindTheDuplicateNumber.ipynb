    "- Set 2 pointers, a fast and slow one. Slow pointer moves right by 1 each time, Fast moves right by 2 each time\n",
    "- Since we're guaranteed that there's a cycle, we know the two will meet and when they do, we break out of the loop\n",
    "- We then do a second pass. Where we have another pointer that travels a p distance until it meets the slow pointer (which is stuck in the cycle)\n",
    "- Once the two meet, return the slow pointer (which will be the correct answer)"
